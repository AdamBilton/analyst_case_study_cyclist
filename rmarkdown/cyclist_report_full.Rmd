Removing duplicated ride ID

Checking bike types
```{r}

Checking start/end location IDs
```{r, echo = T, results = 'hide'}

Checking membership types
```{r}

Checking trip start time and end time
```{r echo = T, results = 'hide'}

Calculating route length (in seconds)

# Analysis

## Logistic regression to test which variables significantly impact member/casual rates

```{r, model}
# removed weekday_weekend as it is derived from day of the week and causing collinearity

cyclistic_logistic_regression_model <- glm(member_casual ~ rideable_type + journey_time + day_of_week + month +
                                             time_of_day + holidays + journey_grouping,
                                           data = cyclist_data_cleaned, family = binomial)

summary(cyclistic_logistic_regression_model)

- We see here that there is a steady trend for increasing proportion of casual riders from Jan - July

- this is in conjunction with an increase in total riders from Jan - Aug
- and a decrease in riders from Aug - Jan

### Is temperature a potential explanatory factor for increased casual use over the months?

```{r include=FALSE}
# prep for plot

combined_rides_month <- merge(combined_rides_month, chicago_temperatures, by.x = "month", by.y = "Average", all.x = TRUE)
```
```{r}
# correlation of temperature and proportion og casual riders
cor(combined_rides_month$Temp, combined_rides_month$casual_proportion)
```
- a very strong positive correlation between temperature and proportion of casual users
```{r}
# regression for relationship between temperature and proportion of casual riders
test_model <- lm(casual_proportion ~ Temp, data = combined_rides_month)
summary(test_model)
```
```{r, warning=FALSE}
 # plot: temperature against proportion of casual riders
ggplot(data = combined_rides_month, aes(x = Temp, y = casual_proportion))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+
  labs(title = "Relationship between monthly average temperature and proportion of casual users",
       x = "Temperature (°C)",
       y = "Proportion of casual riders (%)")+
  theme_minimal()+
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 18, y = 35, label = expression(paste("R"^2, " = 0.9555")), size = 4, angle = 29)
```
This regression model and plot suggest a strong and significant relationship (p = 2.717e-08) between temperature and casual user proportion with the model explaining 96% of the observed variance in the data. For each degree increase in temperature (C) the proportion of casual use increases by roughly 0.9%

```
- Casual riders make up a larger proportion of riders on the weekend
- Slightly more casual riders on Fridays and Monday, could be a result of bank holiday weekends which were not assessed
- These results were also visible in the weekday/weekend split which was removed from the logistic regression model

- peak bike usage occurs in the afternoon between 12:00 and 17:59.
- though the highest proportion of casual users is after midnight it will likely be ineffective to target this for conversion of casual users to members as there a significantly less rides occurring over between the hours of 00:00 and 05:59

- this clearly shows that a large portion of the current usage is short journeys by members
- though casual riders become a higher proportion of rides as journey become longer the total number of journeys decreases
- while targeting higher journey times may bring in casual riders to memberships, those journey types are far less frequent

## Assessing the location data

### Comparing starting locations between member and casual users

![starting locations heat map](D:/Program Files/Documents/3. Data/Projects/26.05.24_case_study_cyclist/other/journey_start_heatmap.png)

- regarding points of interest, it appears there are more casual rides starting at the Chigaco Midway International Airport

### Comparing ending locations between member and casual users

![Ending locations heat map](D:/Program Files/Documents/3. Data/Projects/26.05.24_case_study_cyclist/other/journey_end_heatmap.png)

- similar to journey starting points, there are more casual rides ending at the Chigaco Midway International Airport

# Discussion 

## Process Summary

- A large percentage (~99%) of the data was retained after cleaning, so findings can be considered reliable and representative of the user base

- The available data and collection of other data sources such as holiday dates and monthly temperatures allowed for the calculation of numerous metrics, many of which were influential factors in the likelihood of a person being a member/casual user

- Data was modeled to identify significant findings and visuals/comments were provided to describe those findings

## Finding Summary

Aspects which impacted the likelihood of being a casual user (the target group) were:

- **Month of the year:** Summer months and higher temperature led to a higher proportion of casual use

- **Day of the week:** Weekends showed a higher proportion of casual use

- **Time of day:** Morning had the lowest proportion of casual use while proportion of casual use was highest between 00:00 and 05:59

- **Journey length:** Casual users were more likely to have longer journey times

- **Bike type:** Casual users has a slight preference for electric bikes

- **Journey locations:** It appears that casual journeys to and from the airport are more common in comparison to member routes

## Caveats

- Data over the previous year was missing some information provided in previous data sets such as age and gender so their influence was not assessed here

- As no account ID was included in the data set, it means some of these journeys may be attributed to the same individual, which could impact the findings

- This data only encompasses one year so there may be trends specific to this year that do not appear across multiple years

- Location analysis was based solely on observations from heat maps. These maps (constructed using the 'leaflet' package) were not directly included in reports due to the intensive rendering requirements of interactive maps.

## Recommendations

Though many of the metrics generated here identified scenarios which have higher casual use and could potentially be targets for conversion of casual users to members, some of these scenarios would have a much better return on investment based largely on the number of rides occurring in those scenarios. As a prime example of this, the highest proportion of casual use observed in the data set (70%) was from journeys lasting longer than 40 minutes. Though at first glance it might seem perfect to offer promotions linked with membership for journeys over 40 minutes, these journeys only reflect 3% of all journeys and would therefore not net many new customers even if effective. With that in mind, the following are likely to be the best targets for conversion to memberships:

**- Promotions targeting summer months, specifically May through to September will target time periods with roughly 40% casual use in combination with these months having the highest user numbers across the whole year.**

**- With a very strong relationship between proportion of casual users and temperature, where more casual users use the service in higher temperatures, a short term promotion could be preemptively prepared to go into effect when there are predictions of incoming hot weather.**

**- Causal use is much higher on weekends and total rides on on weekend days remains equivalent to weekdays, so a promotion during weekends or memberships specifically for weekends may convert a substantial number of users to members.**
  **- further analysis for inclusion of Friday evening/night in this membership may be useful here to see if it could boost the appeal/conversion**

Other smaller scale conversions could be made for the following scenarios:

**- Promotions for journeys lengths above 20 minutes**

**- promotions for use of electric bikes**

**- promotions for journeys to and from the airport**
